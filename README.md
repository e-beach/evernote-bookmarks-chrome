### evernote-bookmarks-chrome
I noticed there was no simple way to move bookmarks from Google Chrome to Evernote for non-coders.
This Chrome extension's goal is to make that a one-step process.

Interop and authentication with Evernote is provided by the [backend](https://github.com/e-beach/evernote-bookmarks-backend).

### TODO
- [ ] Publish for the public on the chrome store!
- [ ] Build an attractive website.
- [ ] Add unit tests for odd urls.

### Contributing
If you have any ideas, raise an issue; I'm desperate for criticism, commentary, or code :blush:.
